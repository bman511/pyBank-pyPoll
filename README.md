# Polling and Banking with Python

This excercise uses a couple of different data sources for analysis.  One is monthly profit data for a fictional business and the other is result from a fictional election.

- The banking script compiles a summary of the largest profit loss month-to-month over 86 months of data along with the largest monthly increase in profit.  The output is a simple console table.

- The vote analysis script compiles a small summary table of the total votes, percentages garnered by each candidate, total votes for each candidate, and finally the winner.
